        <h1>Kavari Leonard</h1>
        <p>My name is Kavari Leonard. I am a computer science major and senior at Bowie State University. My skills include Python and a bit of C++ programming languages. I'm currently an intern student at ODU working on human detection using an EEG headset. I'm not sure what my long term goal is after I graduate but I might continue and get my master's and work in the IT field.</p>
